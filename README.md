# DRT
Implementation of [Differentiable Refraction-Tracing for Mesh Reconstruction of Transparent Objects.](https://vcc.tech/research.html)(TODO : update link)

### (Teaser place holder)

## Dependencies
Requirements:
- [NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-6.5.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download) : Used to find the triangles intersected by each ray path.
- [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/): We use meshlabserver to remesh and calculate average per-vertex distance (Hausdorff Distance). Note that meshlab older than 2020.03 may not support remesh operation.
- Python with pytorch, numpy, trimesh, pycuda and imageio.

## Usage
- First, set Optix-SDK and meshlabserver path in DiffRender.py
